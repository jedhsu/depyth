#### Features
* Dependent type theory. Types are first-class.
* Effect type.


**Making type a variable allows type to best represent its meaning, which is a collection / shape, rather than a point-wise scalar.**

```python

class Hstack:
    Tensor[D][m1, n] + Tensor[D][m2, n] = Tensor[D]
    
```
